## WELCOME

Howdy! My name is Andrew, and I am a current junior studying in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. You are currently viewing my engineering portfolio, which details not only the technical knowledge and understanding I have gained, but also the engineering mindset of thinking deeply and creatively to solve problems efficiently.  

Here, I have highlighted the projects that I have worked both inside and outside the classroom. It is with my hope that they will help in the assessment of how I may contribute to your company! 

Thank you for your time!
