## WELCOME

### Introduction

Howdy! My name is *Andrew*, and I am a current *junior* studying in *Mechanical Engineering* at the *University of California, Berkeley*. You are currently viewing my engineering portfolio. Here, I have tried to not only detail my technical knowledge and understanding, but also my engineering mindset and thought process. 

I have been fortunate to have been able to work on many projects both inside and outside the classroom here at Berkeley, and I wish to share them with you. It is with my hope that they will help in your assessments!

Thank you for your time!

### About Me

I have always been the curious type and have always been the kinetic learning type. My understanding of things comes visually and physically so I often like to draw things out and construct tangible models. Naturally, projects have always been the best learning medium for me to absorb, apply, and express what I have learned. I work the best when there is a clear goal and feasible timeline, and I enjoy working on teams that share a similar work ethic but offer different perspectives. At my essence, I am a hard worker and a critical thinker.

In my down time, I enjoy electric longboarding around the Bay Area, cooking and trying out new foods, playing soccer on the Berkeley campus fields, and creating small 3D solutions with my Ender 3 v2. I also enjoy digital photography and like to shoot still life and street with my Nikon D3300 DSLR. If you are curious, check out my newly created photography handle on Instagram: @zhumuchsauce.
