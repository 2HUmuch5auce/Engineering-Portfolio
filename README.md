My LinkedIn profile can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andzhurew/).

## WELCOME

Howdy! My name is Andrew, and I am a current junior studying in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. You are currently viewing my engineering portfolio. Here, I have tried to not only detail my technical knowledge and understanding, but also my engineering mindset and thought process. 

I have been fortunate to have been able to work on many projects both inside and outside the classroom, and I wish to share them with you. It is with my hope that they will help in the assessment of how I may contribute to your company!

Thank you for your time!
